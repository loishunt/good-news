  <h4>Indian District Becomes First Territory to be 100% Solar Powered</h4>
  <p>A district in India has just become the first of the country’s union territories to be 100% powered by solar energy. Diu, which has a population of roughly 56,000 people, now holds a solar capacity of 13 MW; 3 MW of which are generated from rooftop units, while the other 10 MW are generated through regular facilities. Before Diu started building its own electrical infrastructure, the district depended on a neighboring territory to provide for their energy needs. In addition to being more expensive, this tactic also resulted in huge line losses throughout Diu. Milind Ingle, who is the executive engineer of the territory’s electricity departmen, told Times of India: “For water and electricity, the Union territory was solely dependent on the Gujarat government. To overcome this limitation, the administration of the Union territory decided to set up solar power plants in Diu.”</p>

  <h4>National Napping Day 2018: Facts to Celebrate the Unofficial Holiday</h4>
  <p>Are you fond of sleeping for an hour or two during the daytime? Then, this unofficial holiday is for you. Monday marks National Napping Day, which is celebrated on the day following the return of daylight saving time in order to give people the opportunity to catch up on the hour of sleep they lost out on when clocks shifted to the spring time. The unofficial holiday can be dated back to 1999 when a Boston University professor, William Anthony, created the event, primarily to emphasize on the benefits of a quick nap. He reportedly said at the time, "We chose this particular Monday because Americans are more 'nap-ready' than usual after losing an hour of sleep to daylight saving time."
  It has been eagerly celebrated by sleep-deprived Americans ever since.</p>
